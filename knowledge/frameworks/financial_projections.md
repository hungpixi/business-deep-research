# Financial Projections Framework
# Tham khảo: Corporate Finance (FTU/UEH), Financial Modeling

## I. Revenue Projections (3-5 năm)

### Revenue Model Types
- **Subscription/SaaS**: MRR x 12 = ARR, growth rate, churn
- **Transaction-based**: GMV x Take rate
- **Advertising**: DAU x Impressions x CPM
- **Service-based**: Billable hours x Rate
- **Product sales**: Units x Price

### Revenue Forecasting
- Bottom-up: # customers x ARPU x 12 months
- Top-down: TAM x Market share %
- Hybrid approach recommended
- Growth assumptions: Conservative, Base, Aggressive

## II. Cost Structure

### Fixed Costs (Monthly)
- Nhân sự (salaries + benefits)
- Văn phòng/hosting/infrastructure
- Software licenses
- Insurance
- Depreciation

### Variable Costs
- COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
- Marketing/Sales (CAC-based)
- Transaction fees
- Logistics/delivery
- Customer support scaling

### One-time Costs
- Incorporation/legal setup
- Product development (MVP)
- Equipment
- Initial marketing launch

## III. P&L Statement (Profit & Loss)

```
Revenue
- COGS
= Gross Profit (Gross Margin %)
- Operating Expenses
  - Marketing & Sales
  - R&D / Product
  - G&A (General & Administrative)
= EBITDA
- Depreciation & Amortization
= EBIT (Operating Income)
- Interest Expense
= EBT (Earnings Before Tax)
- Tax (CIT 20% VN)
= Net Income (Net Margin %)
```

## IV. Cash Flow Statement

```
Net Income
+ Depreciation & Amortization
+/- Changes in Working Capital
  - Accounts Receivable
  - Inventory
  + Accounts Payable
= Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)

- CapEx (Capital Expenditures)
- Acquisitions
= Cash Flow from Investing (CFI)

+ Equity Raised
+ Debt Issued
- Debt Repaid
- Dividends
= Cash Flow from Financing (CFF)

Net Cash Flow = CFO + CFI + CFF
Ending Cash = Beginning Cash + Net Cash Flow
```

## V. Break-Even Analysis

- BEP (Units) = Fixed Costs / (Price - Variable Cost per unit)
- BEP (Revenue) = Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin Ratio
- Contribution Margin = Revenue - Variable Costs
- Contribution Margin Ratio = CM / Revenue

## VI. Key Financial Ratios

| Ratio | Formula | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Gross Margin | (Rev - COGS) / Rev | >60% SaaS, >30% others |
| Net Margin | Net Income / Rev | >10% mature |
| Current Ratio | Current Assets / Current Liabilities | > 1.5 |
| D/E Ratio | Total Debt / Equity | < 2.0 |
| ROE | Net Income / Equity | > 15% |
| ROA | Net Income / Assets | > 5% |

## VII. Assumptions Documentation
- Revenue growth rate per year
- Customer acquisition rate
- Churn rate
- Pricing strategy
- Hiring plan
- Marketing budget % of revenue
- Tax rate (VN: CIT 20%, special incentives if applicable)
